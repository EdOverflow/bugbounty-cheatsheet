# Style Guide

We like to keep our Markdown files as uniform as possible. So if you submit a PR make sure to follow this style guide (We will not be angry if you do not.)

- Cheat sheet titles should start with `##`.
- Subheadings should be made bold. (`**Subheading**`)
- Add newlines after subheadings and code blocks.
- Code blocks should use three backticks. (```)
- Make sure to use syntax highlighting whenever possible.
